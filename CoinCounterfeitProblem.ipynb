Before diving in to the countefeit coin algorithm in the quantum world let us first discuss about the <b> Query Modeling</b> in the quantum world and <b>Single Quantum Querying of the database</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query Modeling\n",
    "The main motivation of query modeling is that It encompasses many quantum algorithms and it has provable lower bounds. In more detail the deterministic algorithm can be shown as a decision tree with the root x1 and its child nodes as x2 and based on the computation decision one of the path is taken and hence forth as shown in the below figure. ![image](decision_tree.png)  Now the complexity is the number of queries taken to find out the output. The quantum model is a bit more complex then this because in the quantum model we dont percieve this as a tree but rather as a network because in tree there is only one way of communication. So far a quantum model assume a quantum state which is a unit vector because mathematically all the quantum states are the unit vector and the basis states are |1\\,|2\\,...|n\\ . The general state is shown in the figure below ![image](general_state.png)\n",

    "Along with the factorization which is polynomial on the quantum computer, the database lookup have also been provably faster on the quantum computer. This is the application of Bernstein and Vazirani parity problem. <br>\n",
    "Information theory is a useful tool for analyzing the efficiency of classical algorithms. Problems involving information retrieval from a database are particularly amenable to such analysis. Consider this database search problem: \n",
    "we have a database <b>Y</b> that contains n items, of which a single one is marked. This database is represented as a bit string y of length n with Hamming weight one (y has exactly one '1'). One would like to locate the marked item in as few queries to the database as possible. The queries are bit strings x of length n such that\n",
    "the database returns the answer <br> \n",

   "source": [
    "where xi and yi are the ith bits of x and y. A simple version of this problem is the case in which the allowed queries x have Hamming weight 1. The information retrieved by a single query xj = δij is small-it adds or eliminates item i from the set of possible marked items. It thus takes n-1 queries to locate the marked item in the worst case. A surprising result of Grover is that a quantum mechanical algorithm can be faster than this and find the marked item with high probability in O(√n) quantum queries, contrary to one's classical intuition. Grover's algorithm does not, however, violate the information theoretic lower bound on the minimal number of queries M. <br>\n",
    "A quantum algorithm employs a database which responds to superpositions of queries with superpositions of answers. The quantum database acts on two input registers: register X containing the query state |x\\ and register B, an output register of dimension A initially containing state |b\\ . We define the operation of querying the database as <br><br>\n",
    "Ry: |x, b\\ → |x,[b+a(x, y)] mod A\\ <br><br>\n",
    "where\n",
    "Ry is a classical reversible transformation which maps basis states to basis states <br>\n",
    "a(x, y) is the answer to query x, given database state y. In a classical query only query basis states |x\\ are used and the output register B is initially set to |0\\. However\n",
    "a quantum database is not restricted to working only on basis states but can handle arbitrary superpositions of inputs. Because of this the information that is retrieved by a single quantum query is not bounded by log2 A. The relevant quantity in the quantum setting is the accessible information in the registers X and B (together called XB) and the internal state of the quantum computer Φ about the database Y. <br>\n",
    "In the classical world if we want to compute a function such that f(x1,x2,x3,....,xn) then the input variable 'i' will be accessed via xi queries and the complexity of this function is <b>the number of queries</b>. Similarly peridoic finding is one another aspect of it which is done in O(log logN) in quantum world but classicaly requres O(√n).

How can one tell in not more than three weighing whether there is a counterfeit nickel, if so which one it is and whether it is heavier or lighter than a genuine nickel?

The difference is that in a quantum algorithm, we can query the beam balance in superposition. To query the quantum beam balance, we use a binary query string to encode coins placed on the pans; namely, the binary string `01101010` means to place coins whose indices are 1, 2, 4, and 6 on the pans, while the binary string `01111011` means to place all coins but those with indices 0 and 4 on the pans. Notice that we do not care how the selected coins are placed on the left and right pans, because their results are the same: it is balanced when no false coin is included, and tilted otherwise. \n",

    "Now we perform the experiment to see how we can identify the false coin by the above quantum circuit. Notice that when we use the `plot_histogram`, the numbering of the bits in the classical register is from right to left, namely, `0100` means the bit with index $2$ is one and the rest are zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we use `cr[N]` to control the operation prior to and after the query to the quantum beam balance, we can detect that we succeed in identifying the false coin when the left-most bit is $0$. Otherwise, when the left-most bit is $1$, we fail to obtain the desired superposition of query bitstrings and must repeat from the beginning. *Notice that we have not queried the quantum beam oracle yet. This repetition is not neccesary when we feed the quantum beam balance with the superposition of all bitstrings of even Hamming weight, which can be done with probability one, thanks to the quantum amplitude amplification*. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the left-most bit is $0$, the index of the false coin can be determined by finding the one whose values are different from others. Namely, when $N=8$ and the index of the false coin is $5$, we should observe `011011111` or `000100000`."
