    "\n",
    "The Counterfeit Coin Problem is a classical puzzle. It has a long history of challenging oneâ€™s reasoning power and ingenuity. The problem goes like this: A man has 8 nickels among which there may be a counterfeit coin, which can only be told apart by its weight being different from the others. How can one tell in not more than three weighing whether there is a counterfeit nickel, if so which one it is and whether it is heavier or lighter than a genuine nickel? The balance we are allowed to use only gives the information whether two masses have the same weight or if not which one is heavier of lighter.\n",

    "\n",
    "As in a classical algorithm to find the counterfeit coin, we will use the balance by placing the same number of coins on the left and right pans of the beam. The difference is that in a quantum algorithm, we can query the beam balance in superposition. To query the quantum beam balance, we use a binary query string to encode coins placed on the pans; namely, the binary string `01101010` means to place coins whose indices are 1, 2, 4, and 6 on the pans, while the binary string `01110111` means to place all coins but those with indices 0 and 4 on the pans. Notice that we do not care how the selected coins are placed on the left and right pans, because their results are the same: it is balanced when no false coin is included, and tilted otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, because the number of coins is $8$ and the index of false coin is $5$, the query `01101010` will result in balanced (or, $0$), while the query `01110111` will result in tilted (or, $1$). Using two quantum registers to query the quantum balance, where the first register is for the query string and the second register for the result of the quantum balance, we can write the query to the quantum balance (omitting the normalization of the amplitudes): \n",
